# Telestickers
I decided to update TeleDark's Sugimori stickers in here.


## Use
Telegram - Add this to your PokeAlarm monster's alarm:
`"sticker_url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IzLuis/TeleStickers/master/Mons/pokemon_icon_<mon_id_3>_<form_id_2>.webp"`
Discord - Add this to your PokeAlarm monster's alarm:
`"icon_url":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IzLuis/TeleStickers/master/Mons/pokemon_icon_<mon_id_3>_<form_id_2>.webp"`
It currently only support Pokémon and it's forms (I suppose it can be used for raid mons too)

## Credits
Of course to **darkelement1987's** [*Teledark*](https://github.com/darkelement1987/TeleDark) for the original stickers and naming. 
Super credits to **Ken Sugimori**, definitely best artworks for Pokémon (imo)

# FAQ
`Q: Why X form isn't here?`
A: It can be two things

 1. I forgot
 2. Sugimori never did an artwork for this forms (Genesect forms, Spinda Patterns, Arceus forms)
